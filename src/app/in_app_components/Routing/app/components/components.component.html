        In Angular, a **component** is the fundamental building block of an application’s user interface. It is
        responsible for controlling a specific part of the UI by combining an HTML template, CSS styles, and a
        TypeScript class that defines its behavior. Components help create reusable and modular sections of an
        application, making development more efficient and organized.
        Each component consists of three main parts:
        1. **Template (HTML)** – Defines the structure and layout of the component's view.
        2. **Styles (CSS or SCSS)** – Specifies the appearance and design of the component.
        3. **Class (TypeScript)** – Contains logic, data, and methods that control the component’s behavior.

        Components communicate with each other using **input and output properties**, allowing data to flow between
        parent and child components. They can also manage their own state and respond to user interactions such as
        clicks or form submissions. In large applications, components are structured hierarchically, improving
        maintainability and code reusability. Angular also provides lifecycle hooks to manage component initialization,
        updates, and destruction efficiently.
