    <h1>Welcome to the Angular Forms Demo Application!</h1>
    <p>This application showcases the implementation of Template-Driven Forms and Reactive Forms in Angular. These two
        approaches to form handling in Angular provide powerful ways to build and manage forms efficiently.</p>
    <h2>Whatâ€™s Inside?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Template-Driven Forms: A simple and declarative way to create forms using Angular directives like
                ngModel. Ideal for small-scale applications with minimal form logic.

            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Reactive Forms: A more structured approach that provides better control over form validation and dynamic
                form behavior using FormControl, FormGroup, and FormBuilder.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
