        **Directives** in Angular are special markers in the HTML that allow developers to modify the structure,
        behavior, or appearance of elements dynamically. They enhance the flexibility and reusability of components by
        extending HTML functionality.

        There are three main types of directives in Angular:
        1. **Structural Directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`)** – These directives modify the DOM by adding or
        removing elements dynamically. For example, `*ngIf` conditionally displays elements, `*ngFor` iterates over
        lists, and `*ngSwitch` controls multiple conditions.
        2. **Attribute Directives (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`, Custom Directives)** – These directives modify the appearance
        or behavior of elements by changing attributes. `ngClass` applies dynamic CSS classes, while `ngStyle` applies
        inline styles. Developers can also create custom attribute directives to modify element behavior.
        3. **Custom Directives (`Directive`)** – Angular allows developers to create custom directives using the
        `Directive` decorator. These directives can encapsulate complex behaviors and be reused across components to
        improve code maintainability and reduce redundancy.

        Directives enhance the efficiency of Angular applications by enabling dynamic content manipulation and behavior
        customization, making the UI more interactive and adaptable.
