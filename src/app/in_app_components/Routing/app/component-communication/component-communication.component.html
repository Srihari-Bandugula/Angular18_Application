    <h4>Overview:</h4>
    <p>**Component Communication** in Angular refers to how different components interact and share data with each
        other. Since Angular follows a component-based architecture, effective communication between components is
        essential for building dynamic and modular applications.

        There are several ways to achieve component communication:
        1. **Parent to Child (`Input`)** – The parent component passes data to a child component using the `Input`
        decorator. This allows the child component to receive and display dynamic data from the parent.
        2. **Child to Parent (`Output` and EventEmitter)** – The child component sends data or events back to the parent
        using the `Output` decorator and the `EventEmitter` class. This enables the parent to react to changes occurring
        in the child.
        3. **Sibling Communication (Using a Shared Service)** – When two components that do not have a direct
        parent-child relationship need to share data, a shared service with a `BehaviorSubject` or `Subject` is used to
        maintain state and emit updates across components.
        4. **Parent-Child via ViewChild (`ViewChild`)** – The parent component can directly access and manipulate the
        child component’s properties and methods using the `ViewChild` decorator. This is useful when the parent needs
        to control specific child behavior dynamically.
        5. **Global Communication (Using State Management or a Global Service)** – In larger applications, tools like
        NgRx, Akita, or a global service with observables help manage complex data flows across multiple components and
        modules efficiently.

        Effective component communication ensures better reusability, maintainability, and scalability of Angular
        applications, allowing components to work together seamlessly.
